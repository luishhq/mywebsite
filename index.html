      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p class="indent">I'm from Venezuela but moved to Orlando at 16, leaving behind the familiar to embrace new opportunities. I developed a new sense of independence and found interests in video games and movies. Family remains a top priority, and I stay connected through regular calls and visits. Please feel free to check my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luishhq/" target="_blank" class="linkedin-link">LinkedIn profile</a> for more information.</p>
      <p>I enjoy learning and believe education is vital for personal growth. I'm constantly seeking new ways to expand my knowledge, such as reading books, watching documentaries, and attending lectures. I maintain a curious and open-minded attitude towards new experiences and challenges. Moving to Orlando has transformed me by discovering new interests, making friends, and learning about myself and the world.</p>
